        <h1> My Story </h1>
        <p> 
            Materials:            
            A 2-liter Mountain Dew bottle 
            A large cardboard sheet 
            A Roll of packing tape            
            A Bicycle air pump            
            A cork            
            Scissors

               First, take your Mountain Dew bottle and take off the cover. Flip the bottle over so the cap is facing the floor. 
               Next, take the cardboard and cut 3 medium sized right triangles that are all the same size.
            Then, Get the tape and tape the cardboard triangles the same distance away from each other. This helps the rocket stay straight in the air, it work the same way that fletching keeps an arrow straight in the air.
            
            First, go outside place that does not have many trees.            
            Next, fill the bottle with water until the 1/3 point            
            Then, take the bottle and take off the cap and put the cork in but not all the way in so it goes only enough that it is stuck in between.            
            Finally, take the bicycle air pump needle and stick it through the cork so the tip is in the bottle. Keep pumping until the rocket goes BLAST OFF!!
